## Part One - Essential HTML

 1. Download the ZIP file of this repository to your computer.
 1. Open the whole folder you cloned, `essential_html`, in Sublime.
 1. Read through `details.html`, `index.html`, and `new.html` and try to make sense of them. Open them in Chrome and play with them. Write down any questions you have about anything at all in them.

This is all you **need** to know for now.

## Part Two - Fun CSS

For a variety of reasons, it's useful and fun to also be able to make our applications look decent. To do so, we'll use Bootstrap.

 1. In `index.html`, uncomment the link in the `<head>` tag which is currently commented out. This will link the file to Boostrap.
 1. Transform `index.html` with Bootstrap classes to look like this: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/boothappdev/bootstrapped_essential_html/blob/master/index.html
 1. Refer often to the Bootstrap examples to see what pre-written CSS classes it offers you and what HTML and classes you need to take advantage of it: http://getbootstrap.com/css/
 1. Transform `new.html` to look like this: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/boothappdev/bootstrapped_essential_html/blob/master/new.html
